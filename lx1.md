**Basic Directory Navigation**

* **`cd`**: Change directory. Use it to move between directories.

   ```bash
   cd /home/user/Documents  # Move to the Documents directory
   cd ..                    # Move one level up
   cd -                     # Return to the previous directory
   ```

* **`pwd`**: Print working directory. Shows your current location.

   ```bash
   pwd
   # Output: /home/user/Documents
   ```

**File and Directory Creation**

* **`mkdir`**: Make directory. Create new directories.

   ```bash
   mkdir new_directory   # Creates a directory named "new_directory"
   mkdir -p directory1/directory2/directory3  # Creates nested directories 
   ```

* **`touch`**: Create empty files.

   ```bash
   touch file.txt   # Creates an empty file named "file.txt"
   ```

**File and Directory Manipulation**

* **`mv`**: Move or rename files and directories.

   ```bash
   mv file.txt /home/user/Desktop   # Moves "file.txt" to the Desktop
   mv old_name.txt new_name.txt   # Renames "old_name.txt" to "new_name.txt" 
   ```

* **`cp`**: Copy files and directories.

   ```bash
   cp file.txt /home/user/Desktop   # Copies "file.txt" to the Desktop
   cp -r directory /home/user/Desktop  # Copies "directory" (and its contents) recursively
   ```

* **`rm`**: Remove files and directories.

   ```bash
   rm file.txt      # Removes the file "file.txt"
   rm -r directory  # Removes the directory "directory" and its contents recursively 
   ```

* **`rm -f`**: Force removal without prompting for confirmation.

   ```bash
   rm -f file.txt  # Removes "file.txt" without asking for confirmation
   ```

* **`rmdir`**: Remove empty directories.

   ```bash
   rmdir empty_directory    # Removes "empty_directory" if it is empty
   ```

**Permissions**

* **`chmod`**: Change file permissions. 

   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh    # Make "script.sh" executable
   chmod 755 file.txt   # Set permissions to read/write/execute for owner, read/execute for group, and read/execute for others
   ```

**Other Useful Commands**

* **`ls`**: List directory contents.
* **`find`**: Search for files or directories.
* **`grep`**: Search for text patterns within files.
* **`cat`**: Concatenate and display files.
* **`head`**: Display the first few lines of a file.
* **`tail`**: Display the last few lines of a file.

**Important Notes:**

* **Always be cautious when using `rm -r`!** It can permanently delete entire directory trees without asking for confirmation.
* **`chmod` and file permissions are crucial for security.** Make sure you understand how permissions work before making changes.

**Example Script (using `bash`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a directory called "my_project"
mkdir my_project

# Change to the newly created directory
cd my_project

# Create a file called "script.sh"
touch script.sh

# Make "script.sh" executable
chmod +x script.sh

# Add some content to "script.sh"
echo "#!/bin/bash" > script.sh
echo "echo 'Hello from script.sh'" >> script.sh

# Run the script
./script.sh
```

Remember to save this script as `script.sh`, make it executable (using `chmod +x script.sh`), and then run it from the terminal.
